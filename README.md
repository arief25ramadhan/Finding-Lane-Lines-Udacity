# Finding-Lane-Lines

## Description
This project aims to find lane lines in images similar to what is seen by an autonomous car's front camera. The goal is to draw a reconstructed line on top of the lane lines that we detect.

## Libraries
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV

## Results

The model can identify lane lines in an image typical of what is shown in an autonomous car's front camera.
